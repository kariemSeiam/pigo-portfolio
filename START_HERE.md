## 🆘 Need Help?

### Troubleshooting Resources

1. **Check IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Troubleshooting section for each phase
2. **Check CLAUDE.md** - Common issues and solutions
3. **Check Blueprint** - Deeper technical explanations
4. **Google the error** - Often has Stack Overflow solutions
5. **Ask AI assistants** - ChatGPT/Claude can help debug

### Common First-Time Issues

**"npm not found"**
→ Install Node.js from nodejs.org

**"Port 3000 already in use"**
→ Run `npx kill-port 3000` then try again

**"TypeScript errors everywhere"**
→ Run `npm install` to install dependencies

**"Tailwind classes not working"**
→ Restart dev server, check tailwind.config.ts

**"Can't import from '@/'"**
→ Check tsconfig.json has paths configured

## 📊 Progress Tracking Tips

### Update IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md

After each task:

```markdown
# Before
- [ ] Task 0.1.1: Create Next.js Project

# After (add timestamp)
- [x] Task 0.1.1: Create Next.js Project ✅ 2025-11-18 14:30
```

After each phase:

```markdown
# Update progress bar
Phase 0: Foundation Setup    [ ████████░░ ]  10/12 tasks (83%)

# Update overall progress
Total Progress: ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 10/156 tasks (6.4%)
```

### Update CLAUDE.md

After each phase, add new code patterns:

```markdown
## Phase 1 Patterns Added

### Theme Usage
- Import themes: `import { androidTheme } from '@/lib/themes/android'`
- Use store: `const { currentTheme, setTheme } = useThemeStore()`
```
